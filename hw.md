# Reading #2: 
- Form+Code, “Introduction and What is Code”, pages 8-25 
- Getting Started with Processing, Ch. 3 (basic drawing)
- Getting Started with Processing, Ch 4 (up through example 4.4)


# Homework 2: Animated or Interactive Picture

### Deliverables

- make the picture either interactive (responsive to user input) or animated (where something visible changes but not necessarily in response to user input). 

	- Here are some ways we’ve learned to create animation and interactivity:

		- Animation: use a variable in the `draw()` loop, change the variable’s value, and use the changing value to alter color, position, size, speed, etc.
		- Interactivity: use `mouseX` or `mouseY` to drive parameters

- Place a comment at the top of your sketch describing your design concept.

	- Simple designs are encouraged for this homework. Here are some examples:

		- A portrait whose eyes change color with mouse movement.
		- A tilted street with a ball that rolls down it when the sketch loads
		- A car that fades into the distance as the sketch plays
